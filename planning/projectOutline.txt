I want my Project to be a Single Page Application.
I want my Project to display the cities that are top job markets for devs.
I want my Project to have user profiles.
I want my page to sort the cities in order of what's important to the user.

Describe a city
    it "should have a name"
    it "should have an average salary" -- somehow...
    it "should have a number of jobs"
        Describe a number of jobs
            it "should be pulled live from Glassdoor or some other job site"
    it "should have an avg cost of living OR a CPI index against the national avg"
    it "should have some other data that conveys if it's a good/cool place to live"
    it "should have a user comments section"

Describe a User
    it "should have a name"
    it "should have a list of cities they are interested in"
    it "should be able to add a city to their list"
    it "should be able to comment on the city"
